## Project Description

This project was guided by Lighthouse Labs Web Development Program.

This SPA allows users to create, edit, and delete appointments during the work week, with interviewers(teachers). Users are able to choose a time, choose available instructors, and input their name, to set an apppointment. The number of remaining spots updates when a user makes a change to the appointments.
